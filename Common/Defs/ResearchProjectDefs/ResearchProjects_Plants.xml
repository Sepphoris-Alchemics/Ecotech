  <!--Ultimate Research Options:
    1: Seed Cultivation: Learn how to properly identify and plant Ecotech seeds. This allows the player to know use the plants.
      -The first reseach will teach how to plant Prima Terraseeds as well, which are the most basic.
    2: Basic Firearms (Small): Learn how to make smaller firearms, such as pistols, pocket shotguns, and PDWs
    3: Standard Melee Patterns: Learn how to grow standard melee weapons, ranging from daggers, swords, and hammers.
    4: Basic Firearms (Medium): Learn how to make larger firearms, such as shotguns, assault rifles, magnums, and stakecasters.
    5: Basic Firearms (Heavy): Learn how to make heavier firearms, such as LMGs, heavy bowguns, and cluster launchers.
    6: Fluid Sacs: Learn how to make various weapons that utilize liquid materials, such as sap and acids.
        -Acid Launcher: fires globules of acid, which cover a small area.
        -Sap Launcher: fires globues of sap, which slow anything caught in it and lowers manipulation.
    7: Spore weapons: Learn how to make weapons that leave behind spore clouds, which remain active for days.
        -Spore Launcher: Grenade Launcher variant.
        -Spore Mortar: A long-ranged mortar that is quite inaccurate, but leaves lingering spores.
    8: Splinter weapons: learn how to make weapons that fire shots which break off into lethal splinters, such as pine grenades and specailized LMGs. Basically "explosive" weapons.
    9: Grenades: Learn how to make throwable grenades:
        -Pellet Grenade: Default. Damages nearby targets, with a chance to stun.
        -Pine Grenade: Requires Splinter Rsearch
        -Caustic Grenade: Requires Fluid Sacs
        -Sap Grenade: Requires Fluid Sacs
        -Spore Grenade: Requires Spore Weapons
    10: Venom Arms: make melee weapons that will poison anyone hit.

  ***NAMING***
    Melee weapons follow loose naming
    Caster = Stakecaster or SMG
    Burster = Shotgun
    Cannon = grenade launcher

  ***WEAPON SEED TYPES (OUTDATED)***
    1: Prima Seeds: Learn how to make the basic weapons of terraweapons, which cover all weapons up to Pre-Microelectronics. Prima Weapons stike a balance between damage and durability, but cannot regenerate health. These are currently in the game.
    2: Verdant Seeds: Learn how to make verdant weapons, which cover all weapons up to Multi-Analyzer. Verdant Weapons have the highest durability, lower damage, but regenerate health over time when in direct sunlight.
    3: Royal/Anima Seeds: Learn how to make the most powerful weapons, which specifically cover weapons that are Spacer+. Royal weapons have extreme damage and the highest range, but the lowest durability. Their health can be regenerated within special buildings.
    4: Perrenial: Exclusive weapons that take a significantly long time to grow, but have ammo reserves of up to 10x any other weapon. These weapons requires special seeds.

  ***WEAPON DAMAGE VALUES***
  1: Prima Weapons - will need to have stats knocked down once Perrenial Weapons are introduced. Prima weapons should instead reflect fast grown, early-game sidearms that are above power in bows, but lower than normal guns.
  2: Verdant Weapons: will have stats similar to original launch Prima Weapons. These will be the weapons that complete with industrial weapons. Slightly lower damage and range than normal weapons, but innate armor piercing, and health regen.
  3: Perrenial Weapons: will cover the heavy weapons of the mod. Similar to all heavy weapons, except with limited ammo that will not regenerate. Armor penetration and higher higher accuracy, but long bursts and warmup.
  4: Anima Weapons: Powerful, weapons with a very small ammo reserve, but will recharge. Covers weapons that are long-range, such as snipers. Very high damage, lower reserves and warmup.

***WEAPON SUBGROUPS***
  -Subgroups are a desired feature that will allow players to "upgrade" weapons by putting it within a fluid sac, which will then split out the weapon 1-3 days later, giving them new properties. The properties are as follows:

  1: Splinter Weapons: An upgrade of Prima weapons. These weapons create nasty splinters, causing quite a lot of bleeding and pain/mood debuffs.
  2: Blight/Miasma Weapons: An upgrade of Verdant weapons. The gene that prevent rotten growth is removed, allowing the weapon to inflict disease and capacitating hediffs.
  3: Meld Weapons: An upgrade of Perrenial Weapons. These weapons no longer deteriorate, and may apply sap within explosives, or upon bullet impact. Sap left alone may harden, and increase soil fertility if on the ground, or cause a target that died with sap on them to create a field of budding flowers or various plants. Only limbs are needed.
  4: Deeproot Weapons: An upgrade to Anima Weapons. Deeproot Weapons are able to communicate with one another, and work together. When a deeproot weapon kills a target, that target's innards may be removed, growing it into another Deeproot plant, such as sacs, turrets, or even a new weapon.
  
  6: Grenades: Learn how to make throwable grenades:
      -Pellet Grenade: Default. Damages nearby targets, with a chance to stun.
      -Pine Grenade: Grenades that brewak off into sharpnel that causes extreme injury.
      -Caustic Grenade: Grenades that explode into acidic clouds.
      -Sap Grenade: Grenades that stun those in it's radius, alongside leaving behind a resin that slows down anything in it.
      -Spore Grenade: Grenades that leave a long-lasting mist that poisons anything within it, causing a hediff to slowly build up. Target dies once this hediff builds up to 100%.

  5: Basic Melee Patterns: Learn how to make various melee weapons that are generally one piece. Includes daggers, swords, and maces.
  6: Heavy Melee Patterns: Learn how to make melee weapons that consist of larger weapons. Includes warhammers, battleaxes, and greatswords.

  8: Potted Turrets: Learn how to make small turrets that are potted. Easily made, but extremely limited on ammo due to lack of space.
  9: Prima/Verdant/Perrenial/Anima Turrets: Turrets that are planted via specialized seeds. Their damage, range, and ammunition is dertermined by what kind of turret they are.
  10: Biocannons: Large artillery plants that mimic mortars. Biocannons rely off specialize plants that are grown near them, using them as ammunition. Capable of firing spore shots, splinter shots, caustic shots, or sap shots.

    ?: Crystalline Infusion: Allows specialized plants that grow their own optics, allowing the creation of long-ranged weapons, such as sniper rifles and DMRs.
    ?: Regenerative Weapons: Allows the creation of specialized weapons which have lower ammo, but regenerate said ammo over time.

    ... turrets and other automated sucurity to be added later.
    
  ***ARMOR TYPES***
    1: Periderm Armor: Steel-tier armor that is flexible enough to be formed around the body. More like a protective jumpsuit
    2: ???: Flak-level armor.
    3: Terraplate: Marine-level armor. Requires a method similar to techprints to learn about.
    4: Prima Armor: Cataphract-level armor. Requires a method similar to techprints to learn about

    <discoveredLetterText>You have discovered that Prima Terraweapons are just one of several known types of Terraseeds. This particular research has unveiled that one of the most powerful types are known as "Royal" Terraseeds, and are carefully engineered with the mysterious - and massive - power of Anima. Products of these seeds are documented to take up to years to grow, and properly growing them requires skill that only prodigies can achieve; however, any given Royal Terraweapon contains power that rivals - or even completely overshadows - Spacer tech that's widely believed to be superior. The secrets behind producing the weapons are currently lost and not known to any; however, records rumor that *very* few surviving Anima weapons may still be out there, perhaps within relative reach....</discoveredLetterText>
