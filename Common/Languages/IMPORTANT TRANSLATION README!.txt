If you are translating this mod, be aware that AT THE MOMENT, weapons have a comp called "CompProperties_InspectString".

This comp is used to communicate key weapon stats and details, due to how customizable some weapons are.

You may want to translate these fields too, if you wish to be thorough!

I will be looking into turning these into language keys so they can be easily translated.
